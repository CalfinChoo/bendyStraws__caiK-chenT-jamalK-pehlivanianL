Team bendyStraws has adjusted the margins of the design.pdf & uploaded it again. Encountered some unnecessary files (.DS_Store) being uploaded so team has added a .gitignore.

Updated design.pdf based off of feedback given by peers during class. Added a project objective section, confirm password section in site component map & made site map clearer by adding a legend (defining the use of color).

INNER JOIN:
- When using INNER JOIN on a table A with a table B, it returns rows from the A table that have a corresponding row in the B table (using a foreign key f that is a column in both A and B).
- Can be used to find if a user edited a story by using INNER JOIN on the Story Masterlist table and the user’s User-Edits table with the story ID as a foreign key
LEFT JOIN:
- When using LEFT JOIN on a left table A with a right table B, it returns rows from the A table that have a corresponding row in the B table, and the rows without corresponding rows in the B table are filled with NULL values (all rows in table A are included).
- Can be helpful to find rows available in the left table without corresponding rows in the right table.
- We may change the User-Edits table to only contain records for stories the user edited, and then use LEFT JOIN on the Story Masterlist table and the user’s User-Edits table with the story ID as a foreign key to find the stories the user did not edit
CROSS JOIN:
- When using CROSS JOIN on a table A with N rows and a table B with M rows, it returns the Cartesian product, a result set that contains N*M rows.
- We do not see a use for CROSS JOIN at the time being.
