Team bendyStraws has finished the design.pdf & uploaded it to github repository. Project name has been decided (Odyssey) as it portends greatness like the team name.

Team bendyStraws has adjusted the margins of the design.pdf & uploaded it again. Encountered some unnecessary files (.DS_Store) being uploaded so team has added a .gitignore.

Updated design.pdf based off of feedback given by peers during class. Added a project objective section, confirm password section in site component map & made site map clearer by adding a legend (defining the use of color).

INNER JOIN:
- When using INNER JOIN on a table A with a table B, it returns rows from the A table that have a corresponding row in the B table (using a foreign key f that is a column in both A and B).
- Can be used to find if a user edited a story by using INNER JOIN on the Story Masterlist table and the user’s User-Edits table with the story ID as a foreign key
LEFT JOIN:
- When using LEFT JOIN on a left table A with a right table B, it returns rows from the A table that have a corresponding row in the B table, and the rows without corresponding rows in the B table are filled with NULL values (all rows in table A are included).
- Can be helpful to find rows available in the left table without corresponding rows in the right table.
- We may change the User-Edits table to only contain records for stories the user edited, and then use LEFT JOIN on the Story Masterlist table and the user’s User-Edits table with the story ID as a foreign key to find the stories the user did not edit
CROSS JOIN:
- When using CROSS JOIN on a table A with N rows and a table B with M rows, it returns the Cartesian product, a result set that contains N*M rows.
- We do not see a use for CROSS JOIN for the time being.

Our team found it interesting that programming is not something the human brain is fit for, but it is still a very popular career. It is also fascinating how employees at large companies, and anyone working to keep the internet functioning has to deal with errors to prevent the entire operation from collapsing.
Concrete actions we will take or procedures/protocols we will observe to make more awesome:
- Understand a comprehensive design plan prior to beginning work on the technical side of things
- If there is an issue or technical error, be sure to communicate it clearly with the team instead of using a hacky solution temporarily
- The InterTubes™ is a dangerous place. Be cautious when parsing - most of the time, utilize what you know!
